Crypto Arbitrage Finder PASSWORD: ptFd4K2ZRRMelmyG

Crypto Arbitrage Finder is a simple open-source project that helps you explore how crypto arbitrage works by comparing prices of the same asset across different exchanges.

In crypto markets, prices are not always perfectly aligned. Sometimes, a coin can be slightly cheaper on one exchange and more expensive on another. This project automatically looks for those differences and shows you where they exist.

This is not a “get rich quick” bot. Instead, it’s a learning tool and foundation you can build on.

🚀 What This Project Does

Connects to multiple crypto exchange APIs

Fetches live or near-live price data

Compares prices for the same trading pairs

Displays potential arbitrage gaps

The goal is to save you from manually checking exchanges and give you a clearer picture of how price inefficiencies appear in real markets.

🎯 Who Is This For?

This project is great if you are:

New to crypto trading or arbitrage

Learning how exchange APIs work

Interested in trading bots or market analysis

Looking for a clean starting point to build your own strategy

You don’t need to be a professional trader to use this—basic programming knowledge is enough.

⚠️ Important Reality Check

Arbitrage opportunities on paper don’t always mean profit in real life.

Things like:

Trading fees

Transfer delays

Low liquidity

Slippage

Exchange limits

can completely remove the advantage. This tool does not execute trades and does not guarantee profits. It’s meant for education, testing, and experimentation.

🛠 Why Use This Instead of a Closed Bot?

Fully open-source – see exactly how everything works

Easy to modify and extend

No hidden logic or exaggerated claims

Learn by experimenting with real data

If you want to understand crypto arbitrage instead of blindly trusting a black-box bot, this project gives you that control.

💡 What You Can Build On Top of It

Alerts (email, Telegram, Discord)

More exchanges or trading pairs

Fee-aware calculations

Automated paper trading

Your own execution logic (at your own risk)
